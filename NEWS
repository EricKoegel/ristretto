0.0.16
======

- Replaced the old thumbnail_viewer with a thumbnail_bar + thumbnail widgets
  , this should make them better themeable in the future.
- Improved file-monitor handle behaviour (handle on folder instead of every
  file)
- Added zoom-mode to remember if the user is viewing at 1:1, fit or a custom
  zoom mode when changing images
- Add drag-support to the thumbnail-bar (look at different thumbnails without
  modifying the view
- Add tooltip support (atm with gtk+-2.12 only)
- Improve caching behaviour (NOTE: when updating from an earlier version, check
  the preferences dialog for the cache-size. It might point to 1MB which does 
  not seem very usefull)

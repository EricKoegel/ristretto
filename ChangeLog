	* src/main_window.c
	  src/pictureviewer.c
	  src/pictureviewer.h: Let the pictureviewer figure out the fullscreen-
	  state of it's parent-window by itself

	* src/image.c
	  src/pictureviewer.c: Emit 'prepared' signal when the size-prepared signal
	  is emitted, instead of waiting for the area-prepared signal. When the
	  image is rendered at a different scale then 'maximum', the 
	  'area-prepared', 'area-updated' and 'closed' signals are all emitted at 
	  once. Then the thumbnail is not displayed when the image is not ready yet.
	* src/pictureviewer.c: Do not repaint the image when the image is
	  'prepared' but there is no thumbnail available. This will prevent the
	  image from flickering.
	* src/image_cache.c: Implement 'enable'/'disable' of image-cache
	* src/main_window_ui.xml
	  src/main_window.c: Remove properties dialog menu item
	* src/pictureviewer.c: Add a 'fullscreen' state, setting a different
	  background-color if it is in fullscreen.
